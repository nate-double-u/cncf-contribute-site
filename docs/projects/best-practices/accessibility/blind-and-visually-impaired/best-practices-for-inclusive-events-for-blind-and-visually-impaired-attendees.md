# Best Practices for Inclusive Events for Blind and Visually Impaired Attendees

## Setting The Stage

This guide is designed to illuminate the unique experiences of blind and visually impaired individuals and guide you in creating events that enable full participation, meaningful engagement, and the sharing of expertise.  
Consider attending a conference where you need to navigate unfamiliar spaces—from finding accessible restrooms and maneuvering buffet lines to locating your hotel room in a bustling hallway—where visual presentations lack description, and where meeting new people means missing the subtle visual cues that help others gauge interest, availability, or conversational flow. For blind and visually impaired attendees, these situations require additional mental energy and strategies. When there are clear verbal descriptions, accessible materials, and navigation support, you enable talented professionals to focus on what they came to do: learn, teach, and connect.  
We recognize that creating truly accessible events involves coordination, planning, and resources. You're already managing countless moving parts—venue logistics, speaker coordination, catering, technology setup, and sponsor relationships. Adding accessibility considerations means learning new requirements, building relationships with specialized service providers, training staff on unfamiliar protocols, and often working within budget constraints that weren't designed with these needs in mind. It can feel overwhelming to ensure you're getting it right when the stakes matter so much to the people you're trying to serve. We deeply appreciate organizers who choose to take on this challenge—your commitment to inclusion makes a meaningful difference in people's careers and professional lives\!  
This investment primarily creates value for blind and visually impaired participants by removing barriers to participation. These improvements can also provide secondary benefits, such as clearer communication for attendees whose first language isn't English.  
This guide provides practical approaches that work within real-world constraints while meaningfully improving accessibility. We also include a [comprehensive checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tCkmOZA5Xji42vN2bxozWO7JtNRI7bcIBMEao2b14aA/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to help you implement these practices systematically—because accessibility works best when it's planned, not improvised.

## Budget and Coordination Planning

Include accessibility accommodations in your conference budget from the start, alongside audio/video equipment, catering, and other essential services. Planning accessibility retroactively—after receiving specific requests—often means insufficient funds or lead time to provide meaningful accommodations.  
Accessibility costs vary depending on your event's size and scope, but typical considerations include:  
* Professional transcription and alt-text services  
* Sighted guide coordination or volunteer programs    
* Enhanced digital accessibility (screen reader testing, accessible document formats)  
* Accessible transportation and lodging guidance  
* Tactile materials or audio descriptions for key visual content

Consider appointing a dedicated accessibility coordinator who can serve as a consistent point of contact for attendees with disability needs before, during, and after your event. This person should understand available resources and be empowered to make accommodation decisions quickly.

Many organizations find success with accessibility sponsorship opportunities, where companies can specifically fund inclusive features. This approach distributes costs while demonstrating shared commitment to accessibility across your community.

## Pre-Event Planning

### Accessibility Needs Assessment

* **Registration Options**: Include an “accessibility needs” checkbox and text entry area on registration materials, allowing attendees to specify requirements such as a sighted guide, screen-reader-friendly schedules, or mobility assistance.  
* **Advance Communication**: After registration, send a follow-up asking for any further details (e.g., preferred communication methods, use of assistive technologies, guide-dog accommodations) to tailor support. This proactive outreach signals commitment and prepares staff.

### Website and Scheduling Tools

* **Screen-Reader-Friendly Design**: Ensure the event website and scheduling interface (session selection, calendar export) are fully navigable by keyboard and labeled properly for screen readers. Test with common screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver). Verify that buttons, form fields, and session listings have descriptive aria-labels or alt-text.  
* **Exportable Schedules**: Provide session schedules in accessible formats: ICS calendar exports, structured HTML tables, and tagged PDFs. Offer plain-text or CSV options so attendees can import into assistive tools or share with guides.

### Information for Assistive Services

* **Partner Services**: Establish partnerships with navigation services like Aira Explorer, Visual Eyes Access, or Be My Eyes. Share detailed venue maps, floorplans, session times, and exhibitor information in advance so that external agents can assist VI attendees effectively.  
* **Guide Compensation Model**: Offer discounted or free “companion” or “buddy passes” for a technical colleague or friend who can serve as a sighted guide with relevant subject-matter understanding. This ensures navigation support coupled with contextual assistance in technical sessions.

## Remote Collaboration and Virtual Sessions

### Platform Selection and Configuration

* **Accessible Platforms**: Use widely adopted platforms (Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams) known for some level of screen-reader compatibility. However, conduct thorough pre-event testing, including keyboard navigation, focus order, and labeling of controls.  
* **Settings Awareness**: Communicate “hidden” accessibility settings to participants (e.g., Zoom’s announcements for raised hands and reactions). Include instructions in pre-event materials for attendees on enabling these features in their own clients.

### Presentation Practices

* **Advance Distribution**: Distribute slides, diagrams, and other visual materials ahead of time—ideally at least 24–48 hours before the session. If early distribution is impossible, share materials immediately after or concurrently with recordings. This allows VI attendees to load content into their assistive tech in advance.  
* **Descriptive Audio**: Provide a described audio track for trailers and other videos (especially for content that is primarily music and visual).  
* **Verbal Description**: During live presentations, speakers must explicitly describe visuals: name key slide numbers (“Now on Slide 5: Architecture Diagram showing service flow…”), explain charts (“This bar chart illustrates a 30% increase in throughput…”), and avoid vague references (“as you can see here”). Encourage presenters to rehearse descriptive narration. Use AI tools to draft initial alt-text or descriptions, then refine manually for accuracy and context.  
* **Accessible Shared Materials**: When sharing screens or dashboards, verbally guide the audience through interactions (“I’m clicking the ‘Deploy’ button”). Provide textual links or endpoints for accompanying repositories, APIs, or dashboards mentioned so VI attendees can explore independently.

### Meeting Moderation

* **Clear Turn-Taking**: In large virtual meetings, strive for one person speaking at a time. Verbalize the speaker’s name before they talk (“John: Here’s my point…”). For discussions, moderators can explicitly call on participants by name.  
* **Chat Accessibility**: Verify that chat messages are screen-reader-friendly, including the ability to determine when there are new messages. Encourage concise, descriptive chat posts (messages with only emojis or unlabelled links can be unclear or disruptive especially to users new to the platform). If using polls or Q\&A features, ensure labels are accessible and results are read aloud.

## In-Person Conferences

### Venue Navigation & Logistics

* **Comprehensive Wayfinding**: Beyond the conference center itself, consider “wrap-around” logistics: guidance between lodging, dining, and transport hubs. Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions or partner with local volunteer networks or ride services familiar with VI needs. Publish these in advance and make them available onsite (e.g., via accessible PDFs or spoken directions at an information desk).  
* **Venue Maps & Floorplans**: Share tactile or digital floorplans that can be interpreted via assistive devices. Label key areas (session rooms, restrooms, lounges) clearly. Consider audio wayfinding beacons or smartphone-based indoor navigation solutions.  
* **Quiet Rooms & Calm Spaces**: Reserve dedicated quiet areas away from noisy expo halls and networking events. Clearly signpost these spaces and include them in maps/schedules. These benefit VI attendees (for respite from sensory overload) and others with sensory or cognitive needs.  
* **After-Hours Assistance**: Recognize that official staff may be unavailable outside core event hours. Offer on-call volunteer support or vetted partner services for evening activities, restaurant guidance, or emergency navigation. Provide a staffed assistance desk, hotline, or point of contact.

### Sighted Guide Programs

* **Recruitment & Training**: If hiring or assigning guides, ensure they receive basic orientation on technical terminology, project names, and typical session formats. Provide a concise training module or briefing document so guides can effectively assist VI attendees with content questions as well as physical navigation.  
* **Opt-In and Awareness**: Publicize guide services prominently—mention in event communications, registration pages, and website FAQs. Allow attendees to request a guide early.  
* **Tech-Savvy Companion Model**: Encourage attendees to bring a colleague or friend with domain knowledge by offering companion passes. This model often yields better engagement than a generic guide, as the companion can clarify technical points while guiding physically.

### Session and Booth Engagement

* **Speaker Etiquette**: Train presenters to introduce themselves verbally, state their name before speaking, and situate VI attendees (“We’re looking at the demo on the large screen to your right…”). Encourage patience and clarity in Q\&A, repeating questions when necessary.  
* **Exhibitor Training**: Inform booth staff about best practices for engaging VI attendees: use verbal cues, speak directly and clearly, offer to describe product demos or visuals. Provide exhibitors with a brief checklist or short training session before the expo.  
* **Signage and Contrasts**: Ensure that all signage has high contrast and large fonts. While primarily benefiting low-vision participants, clear signage also aids orientation for everyone. Consider tactile or Braille labels where feasible.

## Technology and Tools

### Partnerships and Services

* **Navigation Services**: Collaborate with Aira Explorer or similar services; supply them with up-to-date venue and schedule data for remote assistance. Promote these options in pre-event materials so VI attendees can plan to use them.  
* **Assistive Tech Compatibility**: Test all event-related apps, websites, and digital resources (e.g., event apps, session feedback forms) with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Engage VI users in testing phases for authentic feedback.  
* **Assistive Tech Awareness/training**: If A/V staff have some awareness of assistive technology, aiding VI presenters will be more fluid and less mysterious. Having general assistive technology assistance on-site can help attendees overcome unforeseen issues.

### AI and Automated Descriptions

* **Alt-Text Generation**: Use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT or specialized image-description APIs) to generate initial alt-text for diagrams, screenshots, and promotional images. However, always have a human (ideally someone familiar with the content) verify and refine descriptions for accuracy and context.  
* **Live Captioning and Transcripts**: For both virtual and in-person sessions, offer live captioning or real-time transcription. After the event, provide transcripts and audio recordings, with clear markers indicating speaker changes. Include descriptions of non-speech audio (e.g., applause, ambient sounds) when relevant.  
* **Future Wearables**: Stay informed about emerging assistive wearables (e.g., smart glasses that can convey spatial cues or identify people). While these technologies may not yet be mainstream, planning for integration (e.g., ensuring Wi-Fi coverage, privacy considerations) can future-proof events.

## Post-Event Follow-Up

### Accessible Materials

* **Recordings with Descriptions**: Archive session recordings with synchronized audio descriptions of slides. Host transcripts in accessible formats. Include links to accompanying code repositories. Notify VI attendees when these materials are available.  
* **Feedback Collection**: Solicit feedback specifically on accessibility: what worked, what challenges remained, and suggestions for improvement. Use accessible survey formats and consider follow-up interviews with VI participants.

### Community Engagement

* **Shared Best Practices Document**: Publish a consolidated “Accessibility Guide” drawing from event experiences, including checklists for organizers, presenters, exhibitors, and partners. Make it openly available (e.g., on community webpages, GitHub repos) to benefit other events.  
* **Networking and Career Support**: Recognize that conferences can impact professional opportunities for blind/VI individuals, given high unemployment rates in this community. Facilitate equitable networking by hosting a dedicated chat room before the conference, and structured meetups (e.g., small-group discussions in quiet rooms), mentorship sessions, or pairing VI attendees with volunteer mentors in their field.

## Culture and Awareness

### Training and Sensitization

* **Staff and Volunteer Training**: Provide concise modules on disability etiquette, assistive technologies, and how to support VI attendees effectively. Include role-playing scenarios (e.g., guiding someone through a crowded hall).  
* **Presenter and Exhibitor Briefings**: Share best practices (e.g., verbal descriptions, clear introductions) ahead of the event. Offer quick-reference tip sheets or short video tutorials.

### Inclusive Networking

* **Structured Networking Formats**: Organize small-group roundtables in quiet settings; use guided introductions so VI attendees can be prepared and can avoid distracting navigation of materials in real time. For speed-networking formats, ensure moderators announce names and manage turn-taking clearly.  
* **Awareness Campaigns**: Incorporate accessibility highlights in event communications (emails, social media), reminding all participants about inclusive practices (e.g., “Remember: describe visuals, introduce yourself verbally, offer assistance when needed”).

### Evaluation and Continuous Improvement

* **Metrics and Reporting**: After each event, review accessibility metrics: number of VI attendees, use of guide services, feedback ratings on accessibility, incidents reported. Use these to inform future improvements.  
* **Community Feedback Loops**: Maintain an open channel (e.g., Slack group, mailing list) for VI attendees and allies to share insights throughout the year. Engage in periodic interviews or surveys to update guidance.  
* **Pilot Innovations**: Test new technologies (e.g., indoor navigation apps, AI-based description services) on smaller events before scaling up. Document successes and challenges.
