# Cloud Native Security Controls Catalog

## Overview

This catalog provides a structured framework for implementing security best practices in cloud-native environments.
It synthesizes the foundational principles of the [Cloud Native Security Whitepaper](../security-whitepaper) and the Software Supply Chain Best Practices Paper into discrete, actionable objectives.

> **Note**: While this catalog is historically called the "Cloud Native Security Controls Catalog," these security objectives are expressed using the term **guidelines**. Throughout this document, we use "guidelines" to refer to the individual security recommendations, while "catalog" refers to the overall collection.

Guidelines are organized into Families, each representing a specific security domain. These families help you navigate and understand the scope of security guidelines across different aspects of cloud native systems.

Each entry contains the following components:
- **ID**: A unique identifier for traceability and mapping.
- **Title**: A short, concise summary of the guideline.
- **Originating Document**: The source publication (e.g., Cloud Native Security Whitepaper v1.0, Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0).
- **Objective**: The high-level security goal or intent of the guideline.
- **Guideline Mappings**: Cross-references to frameworks (e.g., NIST SP800-53r5) to indicate compliance alignment.
- **Recommendations**: Practical, non-binding guidance for implementation.

### Dynamic Workload Scanning | `CNSC-41`
**Originating Document**:
- `Cloud Native Security Whitepaper v1.0`
- `Cloud Native Security Whitepaper v2.0`



**Objective**

Workloads should be dynamically scanned to detect malicious or insidious behavior for which no known occurrence yet exists

**Recommendations**

- Events such as an extended sleep command that executes data exfiltration from etcd after the workload has been running for X amount of days are not expected in the majority of environments and therefore are not included in security tests. The aspect that workloads can have time or event delayed trojan horses is only detectable by comparing to baseline expected behavior, often discovered during thorough activity and scan monitoring

## Securing Artefacts

Guidelines for securing artefacts, including build process attestation, signing frameworks, key rotation, OCI registry support, and encryption.



<a id="cnsc-141"></a>

### Build Process Attestation | `CNSC-141`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Every step in the build process is signed and attested for process integrity

**Recommendations**

- The signing of artefacts should be performed at each stage of its life cycle. The final artefact bundle should include these collective signatures and itself be signed to give integrity to the completed artefact and all its associated metadata.


**NIST SP 800-53:** [CNSC to NIST SP 800-53 Mapping (`CNSC-141`) →](./cnsc-nist-800-53-mapping#crosswalk-cnsc-141)



---



<a id="cnsc-142"></a>

### Build Signature Verification | `CNSC-142`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Every step in the build process verifies previously generated signatures

**Recommendations**

- The integrity and provenance of images, deployment configuration, and application packages included in artefacts should all be validated using the signatures generated by each step in its build process to ensure compliance


**NIST SP 800-53:** [CNSC to NIST SP 800-53 Mapping (`CNSC-142`) →](./cnsc-nist-800-53-mapping#crosswalk-cnsc-142)



---



<a id="cnsc-143"></a>

### Artifact Signing Framework | `CNSC-143`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

A framework is used to manage signing of artefacts

**Recommendations**

- Consider TUF/notary to sign OCI images. Notary makes use of a “root-of-trust” model to delegate trust from a single root to the individual teams or developers who sign artefacts. It uses additional metadata to allow clients to verify the freshness of content in a repository and protect against common attacks on update systems. Clients can make use of public keys to verify the contents of the repository.

<a id="cnsc-144"></a>

### Attestation Store | `CNSC-144`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

A store is used to manage attestations

**Recommendations**

- Consider storing in-toto attestations in OCI registries alongside the image. Generated in-toto metadata needs to be stored and tracked for which a database or a dedicated store such as Grafeas can be used.

---



<a id="cnsc-145"></a>

### Certification Authorization | `CNSC-145`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Artefacts any given party is authorized to certify are limited

**Recommendations**

- Trust should not be granted universally or indefinitely. Artefacts or metadata that a given party is trusted to certify should be restricted using selective trust delegations. Trust must expire at predefined intervals, unless renewed as weel as a party must only be trusted to perform the tasks assigned to it to ensure compartmentatlization


**NIST SP 800-53:** [CNSC to NIST SP 800-53 Mapping (`CNSC-145`) →](./cnsc-nist-800-53-mapping#crosswalk-cnsc-145)



---



<a id="cnsc-146"></a>

### Key Rotation and Revocation | `CNSC-146`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Rotation and revocation of private keys is supported

**Recommendations**

- The system must be prepared for when, not if, its private keys are compromised. The ability to rotate and revoke private keys must be built into the distribution mechanism. Additionally, multiple keys must be used for different tasks or roles, and a threshold of keys must be required for important roles. Finally, minimal trust must be placed in high-risk keys like those that are stored online or used in automated roles.

<a id="cnsc-147"></a>

### OCI Registry Support | `CNSC-147`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

A container registry that supports OCI image-spec images is used

**Recommendations**

- An internal image registry should be deployed and configured to support internal artefact distribution with the security properties described in this section.

---



<a id="cnsc-148"></a>

### Artifact Encryption | `CNSC-148`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Artefacts are encrypted before distribution and only authorized platforms have decryption capabilities

**Recommendations**

- Ensure contents of the artefact remain confidential in transit and at rest, until it is consumed. These artefacts can be encrypted so that they are accessible by authorized parties, such as the clusters, vulnerability scanners, etc. t is recommended organizations use key management and distribution systems with identity and attestation mechanisms (e.g. SPIFFE/SPIRE)

## Securing Build Pipelines

Guidelines for securing build pipelines, ensuring cryptographic guarantees, validation, and secure build environments.



<a id="cnsc-149"></a>

### Cryptographic Policy Guarantee | `CNSC-149`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Policy adherence is cryptographically guaranteed

**Recommendations**

- The presence and output of each build step should be attested during the build. The CNCF maintains the in-toto project that can be used to secure a chain of pipeline stages end-to-end with cryptographic guarantees. Build metadata should be evaluated against the policy template by using tools such as Open Policy Agent.

<a id="cnsc-150"></a>

### Environment and Dependency Validation | `CNSC-150`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Environments and dependencies are validated before usage

**Recommendations**

- The build environment’s sources and dependencies must come from a secure, trusted source of truth. Checksums and any signatures should be validated both in the downloading or ingestion process, and again by the build worker. This should include validating package manager signatures, checking out specific Git commit hashes, and verifying SHA sums of input sources and binaries. After completing this validation, the downloading process should sign all binaries or libraries it is adding to the secure source

### Build Worker Runtime Security | `CNSC-151`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Runtime security of build workers is validated

**Recommendations**

- Out-of-band verification of runtime environment security, as defined by execution of policies using tools such as seccomp, AppArmor, and SELinux, provides defense in depth against attacks on build infrastructure. High privilege kernel capabilities such as debugger, device, and network attachments should be restricted and monitored.

### Key Rotation Policy | `CNSC-193`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

A key rotation policy is maintained

**Recommendations**

- It is recommended to implement a key rotation policy to ensure that compromised keys will cease to be usable after a certain period of time. When a private key is known to have been compromised, it should be revoked and replaced immediately to shut off access for any unauthorized user. Organizations may also consider using short lived certificates or keys, which reduces the reliance on certificate revocation systems.

### Ephemeral Credentials | `CNSC-194`
**Originating Document**: `Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0`


**Objective**

Short-lived or ephemeral credentials are used for machine and service access

**Recommendations**

- Short-life credential issuance encourages the use of fine grained permissions and automation in provisioning access tokens. For CI/CD pipeline agents, short-lived access tokens should be considered instead of password-based credentials. The use of very short-lived tokens like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, etc., will help to implement more secure access and increase the security assurance.
